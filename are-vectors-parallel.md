## areVectorsParallel

### Description

This function determines whether two vectors are parallel to each other. Given two vectors defined by their starting and ending points `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)`, it calculates the direction vectors and checks if their cross product is close to zero. If the cross product is zero (or very close to zero), the vectors are considered parallel.

### Parameters

- `vector1`: An object representing the first vector, with properties `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` representing the coordinates of its starting and ending points.
- `vector2`: An object representing the second vector, with properties `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` representing the coordinates of its starting and ending points.

### Returns

- `true` if the vectors are parallel.
- `false` otherwise.

### Code

```javascript
export function areVectorsParallel(vector1, vector2) {
  // Calculate the direction vectors
  const directionVector1 = {
    x: vector1.x2 - vector1.x1,
    y: vector1.y2 - vector1.y1
  };

  const directionVector2 = {
    x: vector2.x2 - vector2.x1,
    y: vector2.y2 - vector2.y1
  };

  // Calculate the cross product of the direction vectors
  const crossProduct = directionVector1.x * directionVector2.y - directionVector1.y * directionVector2.x;

  // If the cross product is zero, the vectors are parallel
  return Math.abs(crossProduct) < Number.EPSILON;
}
