# areLinesIdentical

## Description
A utility function to check if two lines are identical. Two lines are considered identical if they have the same length and one line starts where the other ends, regardless of their orientation in space.

This function is useful in various applications, such as geometric calculations, collision detection in computer graphics, or verifying the equality of line segments in vector-based drawing applications.

## Syntax
```javascript
export function areLinesIdentical(line1, line2) {
  // Check if the lines have the same length
  const length1 = Math.sqrt((line1.x2 - line1.x1) ** 2 + (line1.y2 - line1.y1) ** 2);
  const length2 = Math.sqrt((line2.x2 - line2.x1) ** 2 + (line2.y2 - line2.y1) ** 2);
  if (length1 !== length2) {
    return false;
  }

  // Check if the lines have the same starting and ending points
  if ((line1.x1 !== line2.x1 || line1.y1 !== line2.y1) &&
    (line1.x1 !== line2.x2 || line1.y1 !== line2.y2)) {
    return false;
  }

  // Check if one of the lines needs to be reversed to match the other
  if ((line1.x1 !== line2.x1 || line1.y1 !== line2.y1) &&
    (line1.x1 === line2.x2 && line1.y1 === line2.y2 &&
      line1.x2 === line2.x1 && line1.y2 === line2.y1)) {
    // Reverse line2
    const temp = { ...line2 };
    line2.x1 = temp.x2;
    line2.y1 = temp.y2;
    line2.x2 = temp.x1;
    line2.y2 = temp.y1;
  }

  // At this point, the lines have the same length and one starts where the other ends.
  return true;
}
```

## Parameters
- `line1`: An object representing the first line with properties `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` denoting the coordinates of its starting and ending points.
- `line2`: An object representing the second line with properties `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` denoting the coordinates of its starting and ending points.

## Returns
- `true` if the lines are identical, otherwise `false`.

## Example
```javascript
const line1 = { x1: 0, y1: 0, x2: 10, y2: 10 };
const line2 = { x1: 0, y1: 0, x2: 10, y2: 10 };
const result = areLinesIdentical(line1, line2);
console.log(result); // Output: true
```

## Notes
- The function checks if the lines have the same length, starting, and ending points to determine if they are identical.
- It handles cases where the lines might be oriented in opposite directions but still have the same length and starting/ending points.
